The Inbetweeners (2011) - full transcript,"Best friends Will McKenzie, Simon Cooper, Jay Cartwright and Neil Sutherland - who are not among the social outcasts, but also not cool enough to hang out with the cool kids who they aspire to be - have just graduated from their suburban London high school. Simon has finally been able to get Carli D'Amato, who he has been in love with since they were children, to be his girlfriend. Largely because they will be going away to different schools in the fall, Carli breaks up with him. To get Simon's singularly focused mind off Carli, his three best mates decide to take him on vacation for two weeks to get some sun, sand and girls before they move onto the next chapter of their lives in the fall. Neil makes the decision for them to go to Malia on the isle of Crete, a popular summer tourist destination for many a Brit. Jay, with inheritance money in hand, believes he can have the pick of any girl he wants. Neil has to decide what constitutes not cheating on his girlfriend, Nicole. Will wants to add a bit of culture into the vacation. And Simon still pines for Carli, getting her off his mind being more difficult when he learns why Neil chose Malia. What starts off as a disastrous vacation has the potential to pick up when they meet fellow Brits Alison, Lucy, Jane and Lisa, who pair up with Will, Simon, Jay and Neil respectively, and with who they hang, out of circumstance, for much of their time in Malia. Will the virgin, who generally makes Alison laugh, has no chance with her as she is far out of his league, and as she is already in a serious relationship with a Greek waiter named Nicos. Jay is ashamed to be seen with self-assured Jane, because she is overweight. Neil treats Lisa like any other female with who he wants to have non-cheating ""sex"". And Simon may not see that Lucy really does like him despite his singular focus on Carli. All these issues are placed against the backdrop of the guys trying to get tickets for the all-day boat cruise, seen as the party of the season, and at which all their dreams - at least in their dreams - will come true.","api.OpenSubtitles.org is deprecated, please,implement REST API from OpenSubtitles.com,So, you see the thing is, Dad,,I could reapply next year,,but if I defer and try again for Oxford,,I'll probably lose my place at Bristol...,Mm...,which is a good university,but not my dream.,Do you think,it matters in the long term,,or is the subject and standard of degree,more important?,So, I got married.,- What?!,- To Suzy, we got married.,You mean remarried.,This time it's for keeps, though.,

I'm not.,I assure you,that once my legal obligation...,to look after your best interests,is removed,,I can be one truly nasty fucker.,Good luck with the rest of your lives,and... try not to kill anyone.,It reflects very badly on all of us here.,Slightly more upbeat,than I was expecting.,They say your school days,are the best days of your life.,But the only way,that would be true for me...,would be if I went straight from school,to prison and stayed there until I died.,How many times is that,she's caught you now?,Four. But this was the worst.,Mask, snorkel, ham.,OK, one last one for luck.,Ooooh!,Good. Old-school wedgie.,To be admired, in a way.,Squashing the balls now.,Ooh! That does not tickle!,Argh!,Mark!

Am I in time?,Maybe a bit out, but not so you'd notice.,Copy Neil.,Sorry.

Simon!,I'm Simon.,I'd better not get stuck,with the fat one.,So, when Alison,initially suggested Malia,,we all thought,,yeah, why not?,It'll be ironic.,Then we had a reality check,and we thought, do we honestly wanna,spend 2 weeks somewhere being ironic,,and obviously the answer was no,,so then we looked at other places,,but we realised, actually,,we just wanna have a laugh,and go clubbing and get drunk...,and be silly, and that this might,genuinely be a good place to come,,so fuck it, here we are.,Just so you know, I've met a really,fit bird, and she'll be along any minute.,OK.

In what sort of way?,Just like, you know when something's,funny and people get it?,Yes?,So in that way. And also in a comedy way.,Neil was a man of few words.,But even for him, this was ridiculous.,Luckily, he had a trump card to play.,D'you wanna dance?,Meanwhile,,Alison didn't seem to be enjoying...,my hilarious Greek waiter impression.,So, I presume he wooed you with the old,,""Hh'I love you, hh'I love you!,""You hh'only girl for me!,There's no hh'other girl hh'in my life!,""Oh, wait, here comes the next plane,from Newcastle. I've gotta go, baby"".,Sorry, you do realise,I'm not playing along with the joke.,I do genuinely have a Greek waiter,boyfriend called Nicos.,No, of course you do.,Brilliant.

,Film reels are valuable ,assets of the cinema, right?,This place is about to close down.,It's going to be demolished next month. ,Keeping the film reels is pointless.,I don't understand what you're saying.,What's there not to understand?,Isn't this cinema nearly a hundred years old?,Oh, is it going to be renovated?,Is that so? That's great. ,Nobody watches movies anymore these days.,Hey, hey, hey, hey.,Ah, this is ""Raihun"" (title of a movie).,Do you know it if you watch it?,Anna, a country girl, was deceived ,by a man and had a miscarriage.,She hides the truth and ,works as a maid for a living.,But she gets exposed and ,gets kicked out in the heavy snow.,Lilian Gish, who plays Anna, ,is so beautiful, so I remember.,What the... I've made up,my mind to burn the film reels.,This theater was built by my grandfather, ,probably in the Taisho era.,""Raihun"" was released in Tokyo in 1922.,The following year, this theater was established.,My grandfather watched that film in Tokyo,and decided to screen it as, the first film at Asahi Theater.,How can we burn such an important film?,If we don't burn this important film, ,how can we make up our minds?,They say a grocery store ,can survive for three generations.,There's no choice. ,Times change, you know?,Times change?,If this place disappears, ,where will the locals watch movies?,Who should I ask if you ask me?,It has survived many disasters ,over the past century, even earthquakes.,That means this theater ,shouldn't disappear even more.,In the end, it was defeated, by the COVID-19 pandemic.,It will take another year or, two to return to normal life.,It can't hold on for that long.,Relying on donations... and such?,We don't accept donations. ,They should go to other theaters, right?,It would be meaningful if other, theaters could be saved.,That's how I convinced myself and ,made up my mind to burn the film reels.,Alright? If you understood, just leave.,What are you doing?,-I'm telling you... ,-What are you doing?,What's going on?,I stepped on something.,I'll have a headache if this place is gone.,I don't care what you do. ,I've already decided.,I don't know your reasons, ,but it will give me a headache.,Okay, fine. Go sightseeing then.,I'm not here for sightseeing.,Then why are you here?,I'm here... to rebuild this theater.,Huh?,Someone asked me to find an ,old man with a beer belly...,Um... that is... to find the person in charge here.,They said the venue is good, but the film ,lineup is lousy, and they asked me to rebuild it.,You're really stubborn, old man.,What's with the ""old man"" attitude?,Well, you're an old man. ,What's wrong with calling you that?,Shut up, kid. I'm not playing around.,I'm not playing around... ah!,By the way, who are you?,It doesn't matter who I am.,It does matter. ,Being pointed at by a stranger...,You better give me your name, ,or I'll call the police.,Mogi...,Mogi?,Mogi Riko ,(sounds like ""ticket collector"" in Japanese).,Right, Mogi Riko.,I'm Mogi Riko.,My real name is Asahi Hamano.,Hamano as in ""seaside"" and ""field."",During my first year of high school, ,the Great East Japan Earthquake happened.,My dad used to work at, a taxi company in Koriyama.,But all transportation companies, were afraid of radiation,and didn't send cars for decontamination workers.,So, he decided to go to Minamisoma ,alone to be in charge of transportation.,Gasoline was scarce, ,and natural gas taxis were in high demand.,At first, he received praise,,but when it was known that he made a lot of money,,people's attitudes changed, and they accused him, of profiting from the national disaster.,His company was called ,""Hamano Asahi Transportation."",And my name, including both my first ,and last names, was associated with it.,As a result, my family faced harassment.,My mother and younger brother, ,who stayed in Koriyama, were also ostracized.,Our family was on the verge of falling apart.,Because of those rumors,,I lost all my friends. ,They all left me like the receding tide.,Hey.,How did you get the key to the rooftop?,You can't go up there without ,permission from the teachers.,-Sorry. ,-Hmm.,So... how did you get the key?,I... made a spare.,Huh?,I also have a spare key.,This place is nice for some alone time.,But... it's not good if you jump from here.,What's with that expression?,Why...,I've seen you before.,And you're kind of famous at our school too.,Every time, you look like you want to die.,Today, seeing you like that, ,I had to stop you.,It's like I'm the monitor for ,the cliffs of Toshinbo or something.,It's up to you how you want to do it; ,it's your freedom.,But now is also my precious time to relax.,If someone jumps off a building in front of me, ,it will be traumatizing for my soul.,I heard you're transferring to another school?,Where are you transferring to?,Tokyo.,Tokyo is great. ,I used to live there.,It has everything and is very convenient.,But I don't want to go.,Maybe it's better than living ,here with no friends.,I've been here for years, ,and I still have two more to go.,I feel really sorry about it.,But... the world is not just this place, ,you know?,Come with me.,This place is perfect for secretly watching movies.,Here we are.,Hey, Tanaka-sensei. ,Are you using this room?,Sorry, Principal. I'm tutoring a student.,Okay, I just saw the door was unlocked.,Goodbye.,Take care.,That was close. Thankfully, ,it hadn't started playing yet.,Dad, it's because he doesn't truly love ,someone that he acts like this.,If you love Mom, ,why did you abandon her?,If you don't want to leave Mom, ,why don't you love her?,Dad is just full of lies,Dad, please use your true heart to love Mom,(The end of the play),You can't tell on DVDs, but with film,,say half the time is pitch black.,Do you have a notebook?,I need a pen too.,Film is made up of frames, ,24 frames per second.,When you connect them, ,it becomes a film strip.,To project it onto a screen, ,you need a projector.,The projector allows light to pass ,through the film and onto the screen.,But there are lines between each frame of the film.,If you directly project it continuously, ,you'll see those lines.,So the projector uses a ,shutter to block those lines.,The shutter has notches that look like a fan.,Between the fan blades, ,a brief ray of light emerges.,The shutter only allows light ,to pass through the fan blades.,It relies on the lingering afterimage ,of that moment to carry over to the next frame.,Have you heard of the phenomenon ,of visual persistence in human eyes?,It means that half the time, ,you're looking at a dark screen.,Sounds quite interesting, doesn't it?,Half the time, watching darkness, ,yet still moved and laughing.,That's why movie enthusiasts tend ,to have a gloomy personality, right?,But that's not a bad thing, right?,Tokyo has many movie theaters, you know.,Mostly multiplexes, I guess.,Let me tell you something.,Imagine what it will be like 100 years from now.,Anyway, you won't be in this world by then.,How about it?,I thought you were going ,to say something inspiring.,Can adults who say such things be trusted?,Anyway, it's okay not to hurry and die today.,""It's okay""... It sounds strange to say ""it's okay."",Riko Mogi?,Yes, Mogi... Riko Mogi.,I'm Riko Mogi.,Mogi... the ticket collector...,Are you messing with me, ,you little brat?,I'm serious, that's my real name. ,I won't change it.,You can't even speak clearly.,I was born for movies, ,and I can operate projectors too.,Once you teach me, I'll be able to do it.,I told you, we're closing.,There's no need to hire anyone.,And even before the pandemic, ,nobody came anymore.,Although I'm the owner, ,my real profession is electrical work.,Otherwise, how could I make a living?,There was a time when movie theaters ,were busier than electrical work.,But that was a long time ago.,But... we don't need to demolish it, right?,I've already talked to the real estate company.,A company wants to buy this place, ,saying they'll build a large public bath.,They'll set up a small stage and invite singers.,They'll also create a rehabilitation center ,on the second floor.,Benefiting the community, ,benefiting the people.,Which real estate company, are you talking about?,Why do you want to know?,Never mind. Which one?,Sorry, I wanted to ask about Asahi Theater.,Oh, what about Asahi Theater?,I want to know which company wants to buy it.,And if it can be prevented from, being demolished.,Uh... something like that...,Yasuza!,Oh, Who is this young lady?,I don't know either...,He's my relative. My grandmother asked ,me not to let it be demolished...,What's going on...?,-I don't know... ,-That theater was built by my ancestors.,-My grandfather ,-Yes, so we are... relatives.,His grandfather's cousin's ,grandniece is my grandmother.,My grandfather didn't have any brothers...,My family moved away, ,but we never forgot this theater.,Not only my grandmother, but our ,relatives in Koriyama also want to preserve it.,I don't have any relatives in Koriyama...,Movies... It won't do if the movie theater is gone, right?,I've been going there since ,I was a child to watch movies...,Yes, spending two hours in the darkness,and entering another world.,Escaping the pain of real life.,After watching, we return to reality, ,but with added motivation.,Movies can't fill our stomachs, but... but...,Life feels a bit lonely without movies.,Right, so...,I'm in debt.,I couldn't make a profit anyway, ,and air conditioning costs a lot.,I've held on until now, ,but I've reached my limit.,- If you understand, go home. ,- How much money?,How much money do you owe?,- Why should I tell you... ,- How much exactly?,4.5 million yen.,Yasuzo.,What's there to be afraid of? It's not money ,owed for food, drink, gambling, or prostitution.,It's to save the theater. ,There's nothing shameful about it.,Running a theater is not that different from gambling.,Although they say distant relatives ,are not as good as close neighbors,,But isn't it a good thing that, distant relatives are so proactive in helping?,By the way, you actually have such,a young relative?,Relative?,She said she's a relative, ,but I've never seen her..,Um... when is the deadline for repaying the debt?,Well, it was bought by the owner of ""I Enterprise."",The handover date is on the 25th of next month.,I'll contact them and see.,- Please. ,- I Enterprise... I Enterprise...,Such a good company. They really ,rest on Saturdays and Sundays.,- They're closed today. ,- I see.,Anyway, I'll figure out a solution ,myself. Thank you.,What a shame.,what are you doing?,I want to try Crowdfunding.,Oh, like fundraising?,There are fundraising options, but ,it's easier to succeed with rewards.,What do you mean by rewards?,Tickets to this cinema or ,souvenirs, for example.,Excuse me, sir. Can I film the ,audience seats?,Miss Riko Mogi, that's enough.,No, we can't give up.,It's already enough that you, an outsider,,an outsider, have such goodwill.,(Closure Notice),When I was talking to the real ,estate agent earlier,,I lied, but you didn't expose it. ,Why?,You actually want to keep running ,the theater, don't you?,I used to work at a film distribution ,company in Tokyo,But it went bankrupt due to the pandemic.,Of course, it's not just the film ,industry that's struggling.,People in all industries are having, a tough time.,But I had finally gotten the hang of, my job,,and I wanted to introduce ,interesting movies to theaters.,But one theater after another closed down.,Without theaters, there's no way, to screen movies.,That's true...,These days, the most important ,thing is having food on the table.,Those who produce rice and, vegetables are truly remarkable.,I'm grateful for them.,but…,The people who work hard, every day in the fields,probably have a part of them that, relies on movies,,art, music, things that don't fill the stomach,,to soothe their souls.,My younger brother is a rice farmer, ,and he loves watching movies.,He must want the theater to keep running...,He took his own life.,The year after the earthquake.,After enduring great tribulations, ,he still worked hard to grow good rice.,He came here to watch ,a movie before he died.,Movies can't save people... ,It's not the movie's fault either.,But there's nothing we can do. ,A movie can't save the life of a rice farmer.,That's a more accurate ,way to put it.,We've reached the limit. No one ,wants to come watch movies anymore.,The theater doesn't fit the trends ,of the times, especially in the countryside.,I've done enough already.,I appreciate your kindness. ,Thank you.,But, it's already over.,Do you understand? ,If you do, go home.,Idiot.,Idiot. It hasn't even started yet.,Why are you quoting ""Bravest Number One"" ,at an old man like me?,- I want to live in this town.,- Ah?,Nothing has started here yet.,I transferred to Tokyo, but I still ,couldn't fit in with the new class.,I had no place to stay ,at home either.,I dropped out of school in the first semester ,of my third year of high school.,Sorry, teacher...,Well, then I'll go.,Hamano.,I wrote a letter saying I would come.,Sorry for the bad timing...,Hamano Asahi, ,from Hamano Asahi Transportation.,Don't bring that up. ,What about your boyfriend?,He's not my boyfriend. ,Who was he again?,Long time no see. Why do you still ,have that ""I want to die"" look?,i ran away from home.,Really?,Yes.,What about school?,I... I quit.,A serious child like you chose a difficult path.,What did you do in Tokyo?,I just kept watching movies.,Come in. Hmm.,- Find a place to sit anywhere. ,- Okay.,- Sit on the chair. ,- Ah.,Thank you.,- Phone number. ,- Ah?,What's with the ""Ah""? Your home ,phone number. I'll dial it for you.,But…,There's no ""but."" Sorry, ,you're still a minor.,I'm a teacher at Anami High School. ,I'm Mariko Tanaka.,Your daughter came to my side.,Can I keep her with me for a while?,Sorry for the trouble, teacher. ,I don't know how to apologize.,No, luckily it's summer vacation now.,Please ask her not to cause ,trouble for her little brother.,Ah... Okay. Goodbye.,Sorry for the trouble, teacher.,No, it's perfect timing. ,I was feeling down too.,Let's go watch a movie.,Help!,So, I started a brief ,cohabitation with the teacher.,Oh? Is this kid your former student?,I'm not her mentor. ,We're just companions on the rooftop.,What's that?,Is she really a good teacher? ,Is there no problem?,There's absolutely no problem. ,The students really like her.,The students like me, right?,What do they like about her?,What do they like... Ah, ,she makes the students carry condoms.,Is that true?,The parents would be shocked, right?,It caused a commotion. I even ,bought them out of my own pocket.,But it's all because the adults ,didn't teach them properly.,I told them to carry them ,for their own protection.,But then the parents had the school ,dismiss me. It was a big hassle.,But the students started a petition, ,and the whole school signed it.,That's impressive.,You're just realizing it now.,Luckily, the weather cleared up today.,Really, this place is amazing. ,So comfortable.,Oh? Wasn't the teacher going,to stay at his place for a date today?,What happened?,I got dumped.,Huh?,I got dumped.,What's wrong with the teacher?,I'm sorry. Are you staying at the,hotel in front of the train station today?,You found a new boyfriend so quickly?,What are you laughing at?,- Let's make it more lasting ,this time. Take it. - Okay.,I'll do my best.,I've already watched, ""When a Woman Cries"" twice.,I know. There won't be ,any problems this time.,But every time a man comes, ,I'll kick you out.,You're like a mother who abuses her child.,Goodbye.,Teacher Moriko is excellent, ,just unlucky in choosing boyfriends.,She falls in love as soon as ,she hears sweet words,,and then she gets dumped quickly.,This movie isn't particularly tear-jerking,,but the scene where the two dancers ,are abandoned by the same man,,she cries every time she sees it. ,I really like that about her.,Oh? Did the teacher work ,in the film industry in Tokyo?,Yes, distribution. It means buying ,movies to screen in theaters.,Oh, no wonder there are so ,many movie DVDs in her room.,Yes, but that company, went bankrupt in five years.,And then my father, ,whom I cut ties with...,Cut ties?,He was an abusive alcoholic, a lousy dad ,who forced his kids to give him money.,He found my address,,came to my door demanding money, ,and it infuriated me.,I wanted to cut him off completely, ,so I gave him all my savings.,At that time, my boyfriend said he wanted ,to go back to his hometown in Minamisoma,,so I followed him, hoping ,to force him to marry me.,You already had, a teaching certificate back then?,Yes, I wanted to teach in the countryside, ,and I actually got hired.,My boyfriend and I broke up quickly,,and unexpectedly, ,I found joy in being a teacher.,Then I got transferred to Koriyama.,What happened between,you and your father after that?,I haven't seen him in 10 years, I think.,My hometown is in rural Kyushu,,and I'm sure all the relatives and,neighbors are cursing me for being unfilial.,Why is it like that?,Many people believe blood is thicker than,water and that father and daughter can reconcile.,But that's just an illusion.,Come on,,hit me too. If you don't, let's end it.,Hello.,Hmm, she's is doing well. Don't worry.,Yes.,Oh? Yes.,I understand how you feel, ,but please understand your daughter...,She has her own life too...,But…,I see. I understand. I disagree.,Yes, use the cosine formula over there.,After all, summer vacation is ending, ,and you don't have any homework.,I had a part-time job to, experience the real world...,Don't talk back. ,Solve the problem quickly.,Done.,That was fast.,But why are you telling me to study now?,I think education isn't that important.,But what do you want to do in the future?,In the future...,You see, you have no idea, right?,That's when you need this. ,The High School Equivalency Exam.,Have you heard of it?,Go take the exam. ,People like you should go to university.,But…,Too bad. ,This society isn't so forgiving.,If you have survival skills ,or a specific talent,,then it's okay not to study.,But do you have any specific talent?,No...

JLA Adventures: Trapped in Time (2014) - full transcript,"The Legion of Doom are attempting to use space satellites to freeze the Earth's oceans, creating more land mass at the coastal regions for which they own. The JLA quickly arrive and the two teams engage in a classic battle of wills. This clash leads to Lex Luthor becoming trapped in a glacier of ice. In the 31st century Legion of Superheroes trainees; Dawnstar and Karate Kid are tasked with minding the Legion's museum. Their tour leads them to Lex Luthor's memorial; his body still encased in a large chuck of ice discovered in the 29th century. Karate Kid Inadvertently frees Luthor who secretly explores the museum himself, and soon uncovers the shrine to his greatest nemesis Superman. There he learns of the Kent's involvement in Kal-El's discovery. Luthor following the voices of Dawnstar and Karate Kid takes possession of an hourglass which holds the Time Trapper within. Whoever holds the hourglass controls this entity who is the master of time. Luthor returns to the 21st century, but not without the young Legionaries close behind. The Legion of Doom regroups with a new plan in place; they will prevent the Kent's from ever raising Kal-El, and with no Superman the JLA will cease to exist as well. The JLA arrive but Luthor's efforts prove to be successful, and the Time Trapper causes the time paradoxes to vanish from this reality. Now it's up to Dawnstar and Karate Kid to stop Luthor's plans for worldwide dominance. They find a loophole freeing the Time Trapper from Luthor's control, but now nothing is preventing him from wrecking chaos throughout reality. The JLA return, but well their power combined with Dawnstar and Karate Kid prove to be enough to stop this new menace, or has our time just run out?","Do you want subtitles for any video?,-=[ ai.OpenSubtitles.com ]=-,Now is the hour...,...we set into motion cataclysmic change,to the planet.,The legion of doom shall rule,in a new world order.,No one can stop us.,I do not understand, Lex Luthor.,I thought we were melting the polar ice caps.,No, my dear cheetah, the exact opposite.,As those glaciers swell,,the world's water level shrinks...,...expanding the coastlines,of every continent.,Black manta:,Land we already own.,Another brilliant plan from a brilliant mind.,
